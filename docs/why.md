# Why *Heimdall*?

In Norse mythology, *Heimdall* is a god, who keeps watch for invaders and the onset of *Ragnar√∂k*.
He is attested as possessing foreknowledge and keen senses, particularly eyesight and hearing.

Hence, *Heimdall* is the ideal name for an application, which watches your CI/CD pipeline, 
applies corporate compliance rules, and reports deviations.
